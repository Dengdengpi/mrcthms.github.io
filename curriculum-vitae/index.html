Thankfully due to the work that had gone in to creating the Design System, this task was greatly simplified, as almost everything could be created and distributed through a centralised repository to all our applications.</p><p class=cv__body>What I'm most proud of is the way our Design System manages to assuage most of the main pain points of maintaining a Design System, and the innovative Component viewer that I created.</p><p class=cv__body>As a firm believer in documentation, I wanted to make sure that our Design System was as easy to maintain as possible, and rather than having to duplicate code or perform repetative manual tasks, the Design System would do as much of the heavy lifting as possible.</p><p class=cv__body>The only thing somebody has to manually create is the textual content that accompanies each Component. The Components themselves are a separate repository, the exact same repository that we use across our application suite, so they are automatically updated whenever a new version is published; the tabular data is powered by the PropType definitions using custom-built logic to figure out what type of prop each is; and the Component controls are entirely also powered by the PropTypes, so adding a new Component to our system is as simple as possible.</p><p class=cv__body>By using the in-built properties of the React components, the Component viewer is fully interactive, and allows users to create any possible version of a component they desire, and then export the code necessary to produce that exact configuration in a real-world application. At the company, we have seen tremendous productivity increases as a result of this, with Digital Design and Frontend teams being able to work seamlessly together to iterate and improve the user experience of our website.
