      - At Lost My Name, I am part of a team who have rebuilt core pages of our application in an Express-powered React/Redux application. I am responsible for creating &amp; maintaining our Component architecture, integrating Redux across the application, testing using Enzyme, Mocha, &amp; Webdriver.
      - Prior to the move to an Express application, the site was a Rails application, using Spree with a custom gulp-powered frontend. As a result of this, I have gained a working knowledge in Ruby &amp; Rails.
      - I also built a self-documenting living <a href="https://design-system.lostmy.name">Design System</a> for Lost My Name, powered by a component library that is shared across our application ecosystem.

      - At Fueled, I was leading the Web Design team, which was an umbrella term for both web designers and frontend developers. I worked with companies such as <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/style/ibdl" class="text-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vanity Fair</a> and <a href="http://www.glamour.com/beauty-diaries" class="text-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glamour</a>. As an agency, Fueled specialised in highly-engaging websites with lots of animations &amp; interactions, which is where I honed my design-led frontend style.
